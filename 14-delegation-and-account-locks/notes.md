# Understanding Delegate Control and Account Lockout

## Delegation Control in Active Directory
Delegation Control - in Active Directory (AD) means giving specific users or groups limited administrative permissions â€” so they can manage certain tasks without giving them full admin rights.

### Delegation Control Example: Reset Passwords
Scenario - A Consultant group needs to be made and given specific permission to be able to reset a users password

1. To Create a "Consultants" group: 
- navigate to Active Directory Users and Computers and create a new organization Unit (OU) called "Consultants.

2. To Create a User (Ex: Scott) with "Consultant" permissions
- navigate to Active Directory Users and Computers, create a new User named "Scott", and move the user into the "Consultants" Group
